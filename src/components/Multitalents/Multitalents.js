      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Hafsa Raja</strong>, proudly belonging to a respected <strong>Rajpoot family</strong>, where values like determination, loyalty, and strength are deeply rooted in our upbringing. I carry those values into my personal and professional life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a <strong>multi-talented individual</strong> with a unique blend of creativity and technical skills. Over the years, I've explored and polished my passions in various fields such as:
        <ul>
          <li>✍️ <strong>Creative Writing</strong> – I express emotions, experiences, and imaginations through words.</li>
          <li>🎓 <strong>Teaching & Motivation</strong> – Helping others learn and grow brings me peace and purpose.</li>
          <li>🤖 <strong>Chatbot & AI Development</strong> – I enjoy building smart systems that interact with users intelligently.</li>
          <li>💻 <strong>Full-Stack Web Development</strong> – From frontend to backend, coding fuels my brain and soul.</li>
           <li>💻 <strong>Principal under PEF</strong> –Principal of a Middle school which is under PEF .</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Achievements:</strong> I've built multiple real-life applications, including an NLP-based restaurant chatbot using Dialogflow, Flask, and MySQL. I’ve also guided and trained others in the basics of coding, AI, and digital transformation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Hobbies:</strong> I love reading Urdu literature, journaling deep thoughts, designing visuals, mentoring students, and discovering new AI tools that inspire innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>My Dream:</strong> To lead a tech startup where innovation meets empathy — developing intelligent systems that solve real problems for real people, especially for women and underrepresented communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Weakness:</strong> I sometimes overthink or get emotionally attached to my work — but I see it as a strength in disguise because it shows how deeply I care about everything I do.
      </p>

        🌸 Life has taught me that the most powerful thing is not perfection — it's passion, resilience, and faith in your journey. I'm not just building software; I'm building impact.
